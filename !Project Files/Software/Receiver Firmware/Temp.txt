Why it works:

The initial offset is small (~4% of bridge voltage)
The NAU7802 has calibration/tare functions to zero out this initial offset
Once calibrated, the bridge will respond normally to strain
The strain gauge sensitivity remains unchanged
You'll just need to run a calibration routine in software (the Adafruit NAU7802 library has built-in 
calibrateAFE() function)

Practical Considerations:
Resistor Value	Current Draw	Signal Level	Verdict
330Ω	~5.0 mA	Good	✅ Perfectly fine
350Ω (nominal)	~4.7 mA	Good	✅ Ideal
365Ω (yours)	~4.5 mA	Good	✅ Great
470Ω	~3.5 mA	Slightly lower	✅ OK
1kΩ	~1.6 mA	Lower SNR	⚠️ Marginal
100Ω	~16.5 mA	Too high	❌ Too much power
